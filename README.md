### Objective

The objective for assignment is tot study the architectural style assigned to our team (Microservice) and prepare a 5-10 minute cideo presentation for the class.

### Directory Structure

The directory structure used herein to manage documents and files is as follows:

At the top level, files describing the project meant for users to read: ```README.md```. The only other files that would be expected here is a ```.gitignore``` file, listing files and/or folders which Git should ignore and a ```.git``` file, containing git metadata. There are two subdirectories of this structure: ```/doc``` and ```/src```

The ```/doc``` directory shall contain all information material for documenting the assignment. This includes the presentation and the quiz questions.

The ```/src``` directory shall contain all source material for the assignment. This includes the video.
